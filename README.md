# 7x7 Labs dotfiles

Geared towards a Rails development environment.  Prerequisites: OSX, homebrew, zsh, git.

## Install

```sh
git clone git@github.com:7x7labs/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install/symlinks.sh
```

If you'd like to further customize zsh, you can place machine specific settings in `~/.zlogin`.
